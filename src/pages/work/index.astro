            <p>While pursuing my degree, I delivered lectures and led workshops on experimental design and predictive modelling for data science undergrads. That taught me alot about explaining complex ideas clearly. And I also developed quite a few projects during that time.<br><br>✦ A real-time data pipeline in Kafka + Spark Streaming on UPPMAX HPC.<br>✦ An implementation of a Bayesian sports ranking algorithm in Python.<br>✦ A benchmark and tuning of clustering algorithms on real datasets.</p>
