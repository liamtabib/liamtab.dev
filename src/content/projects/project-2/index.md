This work was done as part of a research project with RISE and Smart Eye, where we created an app to generate realistic driver faces to be used for training and validation of autonomous-driving systems.

## Features

- **Image Generation**: Uses StyleGAN based models with custom loss functions
- **Customizable parameters**: Allows control over facial features, expressions, and ethnicity
- **High-Impact**: Provides real-world scenarios that improve model accuracy in production scenarios


## Impact

The solution enabled an autonomous-driving company to add to its training and validation data for its AD models. It reduced cost, and saved time by not having to collect diverse and rare data, which in
